# Hospital Management System
Hospital Management System using MySQL, Php and Bootstrap




## Need to work on:

1. Ability to accept the appointment by the doctor to acknowledge the patient that their appointment has been approved.
2. User should not be allowed to register if he/she tries to provide the already registered email ID.
3. The password should be encrypted and the password field shouldn't be displayed in the admin panel.
4. Implementation of pagination for all the list view across the application.
5. Bug fix - Bill payment receipt contains multiple record if the patient has associated with the same doctor multiple times.
6. Addition of more fields in the prescription statement to make it more specific one.
7. Addition of more details on payment - such as date of the payment made, amount paid, etc.
8. Implementation of export button in admin module to export all details to an excel sheet.

## Prerequisites
1. Install XAMPP web server
2. Any Editor (Preferably VS Code or Sublime Text)
3. Any web browser with latest version

## Languages and Technologies used

2. JavaScript (to create dynamically updating content)
3. Bootstrap (An HTML, CSS, and JS library)
4. XAMPP (A web server by Apache Friends)
5. Php

## Steps to run the project in your machine
1. Download and install XAMPP in your machine
2. Clone or download the repository
3. Extract all the files and move it to the 'htdocs' folder of your XAMPP directory.
4. Start the Apache and Mysql in your XAMPP control panel.
5. Open your web browser and type 'localhost/phpmyadmin'
6. In phpmyadmin page, create a new database from the left panel and name it as 'myhmsdb'
7. Import the file 'myhmsdb.sql' inside your newly created database and click ok.
8. Open a new tab and type 'localhost/foldername' in the url of your browser
9. Hurray! That's it!
    
### SOFTWARES USED
  - XAMPP was installed on the Ubuntu 19.04 machine and APACHE2 Server and MySQL were initialized. And, files were built inside opt/lampp/htdocs/myhmsp
  - Sublime Text 3.2 was used as a text editor.
  - Google Chrome Version 77.0.3865.90 was used to run the project (localhost/myhmsp was used as the url).
  

### Starting Apache And MySQL in XAMPP:
  The XAMPP Control Panel allows you to manually start and stop Apache and MySQL. To start Apache or MySQL manually, click the ‘Start’ button under ‘Actions’.
